EPA/WATER	2040-AF14	Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category	$0.3 to $0.4	Range: $0.5 to $0.6	$0.40	$0.50	"This final rule, promulgated under the Clean Water Act (CWA), protects public health and the environment from toxic metals and other harmful pollutants, including nutrients, by strengthening the technology-based effluent limitations guidelines and standards (ELGs) for the steam electric power generating industry. Steam electric power plants contribute the greatest amount of all toxic pollutants discharged to surface waters by industrial categories regulated under the CWA. The pollutants discharged by this industry can cause severe health and environmental problems in the form of cancer and non-cancer risks in humans, lowered IQ among children, and deformities and reproductive harm in fish and wildlife. Many of these pollutants, once in the environment, remain there for years. Due to their close proximity to these discharges and relatively high consumption of fish, some minority and low-income communities have greater exposure to, and are therefore at greater risk from, pollutants in steam electric power plant discharges. The final rule establishes the first nationally applicable limits on the amount of toxic metals and other harmful pollutants that steam electric power plants are allowed to discharge in several of their largest sources of wastewater. On an annual basis, the rule reduces the amount of toxic metals, nutrients, and other pollutants that steam electric power plants are allowed to discharge by 1.4 billion pounds; it reduces water withdrawal by 57 billion gallons; and, it has social costs of $480 million and monetized benefits of $451 to $566 million."

EPA/AR	2060-AP38	Review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone	Range: $1.2 to $2.7	Range: $1.5 to $3.5	$0.60	$0.70	"Based on its review of the air quality criteria for ozone (O3) and related photochemical oxidants and national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for O3, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is revising the primary and secondary NAAQS for O3 to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. The EPA is revising the levels of both standards to 0.070 parts per million (ppm), and retaining their indicators (O3), forms (fourth-highest daily maximum, averaged across three consecutive years) and averaging times (eight hours). The EPA is making corresponding revisions in data handling conventions for O3 and changes to the Air Quality Index (AQI); revising regulations for the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) program to add a transition provision for certain applications; and establishing exceptional events schedules and providing information related to implementing the revised standards. The EPA is also revising the O3 monitoring seasons, the Federal Reference Method (FRM) for monitoring O3 in the ambient air, Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) analyzer performance requirements, and the Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) network. Along with exceptional events schedules related to implementing the revised O3 standards, the EPA is applying this same schedule approach to other future new or revised NAAQS and removing obsolete regulatory language for expired exceptional events deadlines. The EPA is making minor changes to the procedures and time periods for evaluating potential FRMs and equivalent methods, including making the requirements for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) consistent with the requirements for O3, and removing an obsolete requirement for the annual submission of Product Manufacturing Checklists by manufacturers of FRMs and FEMs for monitors of fine and coarse particulate matter.

EPA/AR	2060-AP93	Standards of Performance for New Residential Wood Heaters and New Residential Hydronic Heaters and Forced-Air Furnaces	Range: $2.4 to $5.9	Range: $3.2 to $7.7	<$0.1	<$0.1	"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to revise the Standards of Performance for New Residential Wood Heaters and to add a new subpart: Standards of Performance for New Residential Hydronic Heaters and Forced-Air Furnaces. Today's rule is authorized by section 111(b) and section 114 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The EPA is not finalizing, at this time, the proposed Standards of Performance for New Residential Masonry Heaters in order to allow additional time for the Masonry Heater Association to finish their efforts to develop revised test methods, an emissions calculation program and an alternative dimensioning standard. This final rule achieves several objectives for new residential wood heaters, including applying updated emission limits that reflect the current best systems of emission reduction; eliminating exemptions over a broad suite of residential wood combustion devices; strengthening test methods as appropriate; and streamlining the certification process. Residential wood smoke emissions are a significant national air pollution problem and human health issue. These emissions occur in many neighborhoods across the country, including minority and low-income neighborhoods, and impact people in their homes. To the extent that children and other sensitive populations are particularly susceptible to asthma, and that minority populations and low-income populations are more vulnerable, this rule will significantly reduce the pollutants that adversely affect their health. On an economic basis, the public benefits of this rule vastly outweigh the costs, with every dollar in additional cost producing more than $100 in public benefit. This final action does not include any requirements for heaters solely fired by gas, oil or coal. In addition, it does not include any new requirements associated with appliances that are already in use. The EPA continues to strongly encourage state, local, tribal, industry and consumer efforts to change out (replace) older heaters with newer, cleaner, more efficient heaters.
